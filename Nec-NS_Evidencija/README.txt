Da bi aplikacija radila potrebno je kreirati bazu i ubaciti sledeće skladištene procedure:

CREATE PROCEDURE CoachProcedure
(	
	@COACH_INTERNAL_ID char(256),
	@DateFrom datetime,
	@DateTo datetime
) 
AS
BEGIN
	SELECT     COACH.COACH_INTERNAL_ID, COACH.PAYOFFRATE, PERSON.FIRSTNAME, PERSON.LASTNAME,PERSON.EMAIL,PERSON.TELEPHONE, TRAINING.DURATION, TRAINING.STARTDATE

                      TRAINING ON COACH.PERSON_ID = TRAINING.PERSON_ID
    WHERE dbo.COACH.COACH_INTERNAL_ID like @COACH_INTERNAL_ID AND 
    dbo.TRAINING.STARTDATE BETWEEN @DateFrom AND @DateTo
END

CREATE PROCEDURE StudentTrainingProcedure
